1. What is a Node module?

A collection of functions in a file, that can be drawn upon to use within an app.

2. What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?

Exports is only a reference to the empty object module.exports, and cannot be reassigned.

3. Why is using exports recommended?

So you don't accidentally reassign module.exports (and break other modules within your app)!
